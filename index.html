      <h1>Where Do You Learn HTML & CSS in 2022?</h1>
      <p>The question of how and where to learn HTML & CSS is a highly reasonable thing to ask. The answer depends on all sorts of things: how serious you are, your current foundation, what other resources are available to you, what you hope to do with what you learn, and how much time you have, among probably a million other things.</p>
      <h2>You could read a book.</h2>
      <p>
        There are a ton of books out there that cover HTML and CSS (and often together). They probably all do a fine job. These two are my personal recommendations. You probably don’t even need both.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h2>HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</h2>
            <p>Jon Duckett’s is incredibly well-designed and approachable:</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Learning Web Design: A Beginner’s Guide to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Graphics</h2>
            <p>Jennifer Robbins’ covers a bit more ground and is designed to be useful for either personal reading or as a classroom textbook.</p>
